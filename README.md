At least anyone not kowing github will guess "I should have started much earlier with programming. Will  be hard to reach up." when i finaly understood what all of this is about more exactly. (github.com meant). So its worth it. or not? :))

I learned a bit c (should have been about 10000 hours and a bit more starting from nothing with a book called Einfuehrung in c (-frank gehrke and guenther klappheck-) which is a super fine book in starting c and by solving the projekt works at the Fh-Krefeld in programming- programm design and devellopment- system programming- graphical programming with glut and opengl Librarys)in and c++ (about 4000 hours added to the  c hours). 
Had my first PC with a 100 mhz pentium who had the floating point error (an was the fastes pc in reaction i had so far :)))  )
Installed my first suse linux about 1997 a gift from another student because he heared me saying "Windows ist Scheisse" and liked it.
Worked a year for a software develloping  firm who did a callibration sw for home printers and printing machines.
Worked a year for an internet Tv producer.
Did not get managed some difficulties in my Life and lost a lot (lotlotlot) of time with some else and couldnt get back to work on programming experience by being a hired programmer.
